                    When I came here for the first time, I felt the atmosphere
                    of Sri Aurobindo, felt it materially at a distance of ten miles,
                    ten nautical miles, not kilometres. It was very sudden, very
                    concrete, an atmosphere pure, luminous, light, light that lifts
                    you up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As soon as I saw Sri Aurobindo I recognised in him the well-known being whom I used to call Krishna.... And this is enough
                    to explain why I am fully convinced that my place and my work
                    are near him, in India.

                    The more complete your faith, sincerity and surrender, the more will grace and protection be with you. And when the grace and protection of the Divine Mother are with you, what is there that can touch you or whom need you fear? A little of it even will carry you through all difficulties, obstacles and dangers; surrounded by its full presence you can go securely on your way because it is hers, careless of all menace, unaffected by any hostility however powerful, whether from this world or from worlds invisible. Its touch can turn difficulties into opportunities, failure into success and weakness into unfaltering strength. For the grace of the Divine Mother is the sanction of the Supreme and now or tomorrow its effect is sure, a thing decreed, inevitable and irresistible.
                <p>&mdash;Sri Aurobindo</p>
