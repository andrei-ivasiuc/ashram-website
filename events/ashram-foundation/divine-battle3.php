                    In the Divine pattern and Plan the Gods were charmed by the place as it was destined to play a revolutionary role. But, due to the ruins of kings and their kingdoms, dilapidated fortresses, mosques and temples, the evil forces took a fancy to this waste spot and thus took possession of it.
                    This then gave rise to the conflict and the consequent battle between the Gods and the asuric forces.

                    It was in the midst of this struggle that between 1938 and 1940 this land was purchased. Three times the land was lost through legal or other action. When the building was completed amidst several hurdles, efforts were made to use it for social, political and eventually for philonthropic activities, hospital, a nursing home, an agricultural farm and even as barracks for American soldiers, but all in vain.

                    A 200 feet deep tube well was sunk and then abandoned because there was no trace of good and sufficient water. No human being or flowers / trees could survive in this place and in a span of few years, a herd of about eighteen cows and calves was lost through dacoity. The place lay a total waste for many years.

            <h3>The coming of a Divine messenger</h3>

                    Shri Surendra Nath Jauhar had an acquaintance in jail during the 1942 upheaval who suddenly appeared at his residence in 1955. The strangest thing about this man is that the police had completely failed to establish his identity-name, parentage, address etc.-and had been unable to charge him with any specific offence. To all appearances he was an eccentric, and when he first met Shri Jauhar, he had told him that he was a divine messenger and had come on a specific mission to clear the said building, by driving away its asuric occupants.

                        On his visit early morning, he said the strength of the evil forces was much more than he had anticipated and he was exhausted, clothes torn and his long hair and beard completely ruffled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After his visit again the next day morning, his plight was simply pitiable, he looked so beaten and broken, but there was a dazzling gleam of victory radiating from his eyes. In a voice charged with emotion he spoke, "They put up very severe opposition and fought a last ditch battle. But their hour is over. They have been thrown out, completely and for good, from their haunt, and now the place is clear and open for receiving the descent."

            <h3>Inauguration of Delhi Branch of Sri Aurobindo Ashram : 12th Feb 1956</h3>

                    <p>
                        Shri Surendra Nath Jauhar drew elaborate plans to make the place a recreation centre with playgrounds, school hostel and so on, and wrote to the Mother, including a monument for Sri Aurobindo. However, no reply was received from the Mother on any of these points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the historic day of the interview with the Mother, Shri Surendra Nath Jauhar said that he had never received Her advice or guidance on any of the points. "

                <div class="col">
                    <p>
                        The Mother said simply and suddenly, "But why? This place will house the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Delhi Branch, and there certainly will be a Shrine for which I have been keeping Sri Aurobindo's precious relics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the very day of Shri Surendra Nath Jauhar's return to Delhi he received a postal package from Pondicherry, containing a plan of the Shrine of Sri Aurobindo, complete in every detail, direction and design!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <p>On his next visit to the Ashram, Shri Surendra Nath Jauhar requested the Mother to fix up the date for the inauguration of the Delhi Branch of Sri Aurobindo Ashram. She at once fixed up 12th February 1956.</p>
                    <p>He said, "Mother, why not 21st February, 1956 which is an auspicious day-your birthday?".</p>
                    <p>Mother said "12 and 21 are one and the same thing. There is no difference." She further said, "Twelve persons can sit in meditation on that day. It is an old belief that if twelve persons join in solemn prayer-the prayer is granted." Thus the Delhi Branch of Sri Aurobindo Ashram was established and solemnised.</p>

                        Though the detailed layout and plan was received from the Mother Shri Surendra Nath Jauhar neither had knowledge or experience to move forward with the assignment.

                    <p>
                        Shri Pooran Chand, a friend of Shri Surendra Nath Jauhar, who was a Superintending Engineer in C.P.W.D was responsible for construction of all the marble monuments in Delhi. In appreciation of his loyalty and devotion to service he was honoured with the award of Rai Sahib by the British Government.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He assured that he would execute the construction of the Shrine from the beginning to the end and took away all the plans and arranged for proper people from Makrana near Jaipur, Rajasthan.

                        The samples of different grades and shades of marble were forwarded to the Mother for approval.
                        The cube in the centre is heavy-about 27 maunds (approx. 982 kgs.) in weight.

                    <p>
                        As decided by the Mother, the relics were placed under the cube.

                        Shri Surendra Nath Jauhar put up an application to the authorities of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) for naming the highway from the Safdarjung Monument leading to Qutub Minar as Sri Aurobindo Marg.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a lot of follow-up, the MCD named the road from Yusuf Sarai to Qutub Minar as Sri Aurobindo Marg as it had its jurisdiction from Yusuf Sarai only.

                        As the main part of the road from Safdarjung to Yusuf Sarai falls under the jurisdiction of New Delhi Municipal Committee (NDMC), Shri Surendranath Jauhar pursued the matter with NDMC to name the entire road from Safdarjung as Sri Aurobindo Marg and order was passed to that effect by NDMC.
