                <li>We celebrated the Mother’s 143rd birth anniversary with much joy and enthusiasm. We began praising her even before the sun rose by singing prabhat pheri, which is a common tradition in India involving a group of devotees singing hymns and playing basic musical instruments. Our prabhat pheri circumambulated the entire Ashram campus and it was thoroughly enjoyed. The whole Ashram complex was decorated with flowers and a life-size cut-out of the Mother’s Aditi roopa placed near the fountain, right at the center of the Ashr/am.
                </li>
                <li>At 7am the Ashram choir invoked Sri Aurobindo and the Mother by beautiful and meditative chants. By this time many devotees living around NCR also started coming. By 10am the youth of the Ashram had setup various stalls showcasing many goods - wooden stuff made by our carpentry department, our bakery department products like cakes, biscuits, breads, pickle, squashes e/tc.
                </li>
                <li>A beautiful exhibition of paintings “Impressions and Expressions” was also inaugurated on the first floor of the swagat block which was open to all visitors and art lovers. These paintings were made by devotees, aspirants and childr/en.
                </li>
                <li>From 3:45pm we all collected at the Hall of Grace to witness and enjoy the talent of 60 odd vocational trainees and aspirants. They entertained the audience by a wonderful display of Indian classical dance Bharatnatyam , Odissi, gymnastics, and pyramid formation. It was wonderful to see their level of coordination, team work, discipline, fitness, dexterity, and ener/gy.
                </li>
                <li>The final program of the day involved all of us to assemble at the Samadhi Lawns to quietly enjoy the solemn tradition of March Past and Lights of Aspiration. Each devotee offering her prayer at the Shrine then turned towards the Meditation Hall to immerse in the musical offering and reading by Tara didi. The evening ended with all of us receiving Darshan cards and proceeding towards the dining hall for Pras/ad.
