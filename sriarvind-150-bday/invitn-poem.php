                <p>With wind and the weather beating round me </p>
                <p>Upto the hill and the moorland I go </p>
                <p>Who will come with me? Who will climb with me? </p>
                <p>Wade through the brook and tramp through the snow? </p>
                <p>Not in the petty circle of cities </p>
                <p>Cramped by your doors and your walls I dwell; </p>
                <p>Over me God is blue in the welkin,</p>
                <p>Against me the wind and the storm rebel.</p>
                <p>I sport with solitude here in my regions,</p>
                <p>Of misadventure have made me a friend.</p>
                <p>Who would live largely? Who would live freely?</p>
                <p>Here to the wind-swept uplands ascend.</p>
                <p>I am the lord of tempest and mountain.</p>
                <p>I am the Spirit of freedom and pride.</p>
                <p>Stark must he be and a kinsman to danger</p>
                <p>Who shares my kingdom and walks at my side.</p>
