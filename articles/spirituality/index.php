                        When I joined the Course on Teaching Yoga at Sri Aurobindo
                        Ashram – Delhi Branch, in August 2019, right in the first week
                        I was told, “This course changes every individual who joins
                        the course.” This prediction certainly came true for me, and
                        what I have observed in addition is that the change affects not
                        just the individual, but those who are around her too. This
                        could be called the ‘ripple effect of spirituality.’

                    <b>
                        How to understand spirituality</b>
                    <p>
                        Spirituality, spiritual, being spiritual, following spiritual
                        practices…. There is a whole collection of words and phrases
                        using the term ‘spiritual’. There is of course, the dictionary
                        definition, but by exploring the individual’s understanding
                        of spirituality, we can try and discover what spirituality is
                        as a living, breathing practice; what it means to us as people,
                        as individuals and as part of society. This naturally, leads
                        to the conclusion that Spirituality may mean different things to
                        different people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What relevance does spirituality and the householder’s life have in
                        terms of societal context?
                        From the moment we are born till the moment we leave this
                        life, we are brought in contact with the Divine. When we visit
                        a place of worship, when an elder blesses us, at the altar in
                        the pooja room of the house, the little altar in an auto or taxi,
                        the lyrics of a devotional song wafting through our busy,
                        chaotic lives ... we are reminded of the presence of the Divine
                        everywhere, all the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Is our understanding of spirituality defined by the
                        relationships we have? For many of us the answer is, yes. It
                        is our relationships in the spheres of home, family, extended
                        family, work, friends and daily interactions with strangers in
                        our everyday life that compel us to act, respond and react but
                        without a script to prompt or guide us. We could however, say
                        that our lives and we ourselves are Divine work, so the script
                        is already written but we are not consciously aware of it.
                        But how does this Divine work happen and what is spiritual
                        about it? This work or change happens at the deepest levels
                        of our being but it is reflected in the ‘external person’ we
                        start to become. It is in our thoughts, our actions, our views
                        and opinions, our attitude to the ups and downs in our
                        everyday lives, and the language that we begin to use to
                        express ourselves.
                    </p>

                        <b>Strengthening the spiritual focus</b>
                    <p>
                        Based on the Vedas, the Indian culture has identified four
                        stages of life: the celibate student, the householder, the person
                        who withdraws gradually from involvement in everyday
                        life, and the renunciate, who leaves all worldly ties to see the
                        Divine alone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While times have changed, there is a general similarity in the
                        direction our lives take even today to the stages described
                        long ago. We start life, experience childhood, adolescence and
                        youth as individuals who focus on ourselves. We then get
                        married, start families and work to provide for the families
                        we have created and for our parents. As our children grow up
                        and start moving away, we focus again on gradually retreating
                        from family life, and start preparing for old age and loneliness.
                        The last phase is when we take time to reflect on our lives,
                        how we have lived our lives, our actions, our lessons and we
                        begin to focus on the Divine more and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each phase of our life builds on the period before it. We gain
                        wisdom from the lessons learned in each phase. Often, we are
                        rushing through the motions of life. The lessons come only
                        later when we find time to pause and reflect. This is when
                        we begin to understand the significance of each experience,
                        each challenge and recognise the opportunities for our own
                        spiritual growth throughout life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An example from my life is how I have matured in handling
                        friendships. In my twenties, friendships were more about
                        avoiding loneliness, being part of a group and trying to be
                        ‘seen’ by others in some way. Now in my fifties, friendships
                        are for finding shared values in life and accepting each other
                        without judgement and seeing each friend as a fragment of
                        the Divine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my early thirties, being an individual, being different from
                        others seemed to be such an important focus in life and work.
                        Now, I see myself as less separate from others. The boundaries
                        created merge into a space of oneness and unity. I see that, in
                        reality, there is little that separates us all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was a time when I felt that it was important to establish
                        what was right and wrong, especially if I was ‘in the right’.
                        My desire to create a fairer, more just, more correct view of
                        life required that I shame those who were being unfair, not
                        following their civic duties or being unprofessional. Now,
                        I opt for a more ‘we’ approach rather than a ‘I vs. you’
                        approach and share my understanding of what I see as the
                        ‘right action for all.’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is also when our sadhana and relationship with the Divine
                        changes. It grows and matures. We begin to understand what
                        Spirituality means to us as individuals. If we define sadhana
                        as our total relationship with God, rather than just time spent
                        in meditation or prayer, then we see that the Divine has a
                        lesson for us each step of the way. I have learned to look upon
                        every challenge in life as an opportunity for spiritual growth.
                        Even if the element of growth is not immediately visible or
                        evident, I must trust that it is there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a householder, we shouldn’t push away personal ties, but
                        we shouldn’t become attached to them either. We must never
                        forget that the only Reality is the eternal presence of the Divine
                        behind all of life’s experiences and we are mere instruments.
                        When we find ourselves in challenging situations, we can ask
                        ourselves the following questions:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is our intention pure, selfless and born out of love?
                    
                    <li> What role is our ego playing?</li>
                    <li> Is our intention based on truth?</li>
                    <li>Will our intention result in an everlasting peace? </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we are able to answer these prompts then, we can believe
                        that our action is the right action and is in the spirit of Dharma.
                        Life as it is, and the practice of yoga, make us more receptive
                        to becoming more spiritual. Being present and aware of the
                        divine purpose of life removes all social conditioning so that
                        we can get in contact with that Supremely Intelligent Divine
                        that has created this vast universe but also resides within the
                        core of our hearts.
