                        Rome was not built in a day. 
                        The long time that it takes to
                        do anything of lasting value
                        is itself a deterrent. On top
                        of that, the journey from
                        start to finish is not smooth.
                        There are roadblocks and
                        traffic jams, which test one’s
                        patience. Hence, the one
                        quality needed to reach the
                        goal in a long journey is to
                        go on, no matter how long it
                        takes. That is perseverance.

                        Life is a long journey, but long and short are relative. One
                        lifetime is only a small part of a much longer journey of the
                        soul. How we muster the perseverance to keep coming back
                        to this difficult world again and again for thousands of lives
                        is mind-boggling, but we need not bother our mind with it.
                        What concerns us is primarily the present life, its purpose, and
                        how to fulfill it. In the simplest of terms, the purpose of life is
                        to change, to change for the better. Since there is always room
                        for improvement, changing for the better gives us enough
                        work for a lifetime. The work is further complicated by at
                        least two factors. First, what is genuinely good can be quite
                        different from what seems good. Secondly, what is clearly evil
                        can be quite tempting. To know what is genuinely good we
                        need guidance. To reject what is clearly evil, we need a strong
                        will power. The ultimate resource for meeting both these
                        needs is our divine essence, the soul. The soul is so effectively
                        hidden from ordinary powers of perception that to discover it
                        we need a Guru. A Guru is necessary, but not sufficient. For
                        the Guru’s guidance and Grace to work, we need a sincere
                        aspiration that is intense but calm and above all, persistent.
                        To have an aspiration that persists no matter what, we have to
                        persevere. Perseverance is a powerful tool. With perseverance,
                        Edison invented a bulb after ‘failing’ about a thousand times;
                        he never thought he failed, he used to say that he had learnt
                        a thousand ways that did not work. The Mother calls this
                        attitude “a kind of inner good humour which helps you not to
                        get discouraged, not to become sad, and to face all difficulties
                        with a smile.” With perseverance, we can also discover the
                        inner bulb that will take us from the darkness of ignorance
                        towards the Light of Knowledge, tamaso maa jyotirgamaya.
