                        Yoga is an instrument of change, a change that is radical, a change that is for the better. It is a change that affects a person’s body, mind and intellect. It makes the person physically fit, emotionally stable, and intellectually agile. At the culmination of the process of change, the body, mind and intellect start working entirely in light of the Divine that they manifest. So profound is the change brought about by yoga that it is called transformation; using current jargon, one might call it a makeover, a makeover achieved by plastic surgery. If yoga is plastic surgery, who is the surgeon? Before answering that question, let us see the steps in plastic surgery. When a person thinks of undergoing the surgery, she knows she cannot do it herself. Hence, she calls the surgeon. The surgeon responds. Then she encounters resistance from within and without. She thinks of the huge expense involved and develops cold feet. Her wise well-wishers ask her why she wants surgery at all; she is good as she is, and in any case it is the inner beauty that matters. Her well-informed friends tell her that the results of plastic surgery are never as good as expected; moreover, infection is a grave risk and might leave a person uglier than before. But so passionately does she want the surgery that she rejects all these arguments, goes to the surgeon, and signs the informed consent form. A seeker on the path of yoga also goes through similar steps. She knows she cannot do it all by herself. Hence, she sends a call to the Divine. The Divine always responds to every sincere call. A call to the Divine is called aspiration. Then she encounters resistance from within and without. She cannot give up many things that she is used to. She is tempted by so
                        many things that deflect her from the path. Her relationships and responsibilities try to hold her back. But if her aspiration is intense, she rejects all these obstacles, and places herself in the hands of the Divine. Submitting to the Divine is called surrender, and is like signing the informed consent form. Neither placing oneself in the hands of a plastic surgeon, nor in those of the Divine, is a passive process. In both cases, the process is active, and is undertaken voluntarily after weighing the pros and cons. It is undertaken because the person wants something that is beyond the reach of her personal efforts. Of course, the person puts in some personal effort at every step, but the goal is reached primarily due to the exceptional expertise of the one in whose hands the person has placed herself. As Sri Aurobindo has said, yoga requires the “triple labour of aspiration, rejection and surrender”. The aspiration should be “vigilant, constant, unceasing”; to be rejected are “movements of the lower nature”; and the surrender should be that of “oneself and all one is and has”. Returning to the question about who to approach for the plastic surgery called yoga, the answer is obvious: Dr. Divine, the Master Surgeon.
