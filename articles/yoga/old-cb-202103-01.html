    Yoga refers to the movement of the individual from an ordinary state of consciousness driven by personal desires and impulses towards a state of higher consciousness, which expresses as unity, love, power, bliss, all possibility and all knowledge. In
    that state of consciousness, our life is organised around our divine center or the psychic being.

    Yoga also seeks to answer the questions such as why we are born, who we are we, what this world is, why this world was created, who created the world, and where we are headed. Yoga also has tools such as asanas, pranayama, meditation, chanting, prayer,
    constant remembrance and offering, and dispassionate work.

    Yoga eventually refers to a goal. The goal is the union of the individual soul with the divine. In order to effect this union, one part of the being like our mind, body, or emotions can be taken as the starting point to connect our individual self to
    the divine, or our entire being can be used to effect this link. If our individual personality is driven by knowledge and learning, then we can start with seeking answers to the eternal questions through reading, inquiry and deliberation. These eternal
    questions have been asked since millennia, more intensely in India than elsewhere, and there are numerous texts such as the Vedas and the Upanishads that answer these questions. Some exceptional beings who realised these truths, noted down their experiences
    in words for all of humanity to benefit from them. However, even though this knowledge has been available to us since millennia, humanity as a whole has not evolved or gone through a transformation.

    This tell us that for realizing the higher realities, mental knowledge can be only a starting point. It can be the magnet that pulls us to the object of our knowledge. But if we stay content with just the mental knowledge, nothing real is attained by
    us and our nature continues to be what we were before getting the new knowledge. For example, we can understand and learn the concept of One in all, that the Divine is one and from Himself He created many. Therefore, we are all one. But till we get
    a true experience of unity with everything and everyone, we can only operate from a limited place within us, our Mind. We continue to feel isolated from others, we continue to divide people into categories such as friends, family, enemy, self and
    nonself. We continue to work primarily with the intention of self-gain. The knowledge of our oneness does lend to us a compassionate leaning and an empathetic approach to our relations, but it is not complete and hence marred with imperfections.

    Mentally, most people know that we are not the body or the mind, but the Soul. But how many truly live their life making this the central feature? Almost all of us organise our life around the ego, and the world is a reflection of this today. This means
    that until we get a real experience of ourselves as the Soul, we are not able to translate the mental knowledge into our everyday life. Does this mean we should not seek or try to learn anything mentally?
