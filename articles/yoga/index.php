                        Yoga refers to the movement of the individual from an
                        ordinary state of consciousness driven by personal desires
                        and impulses towards a state of higher consciousness,
                        which expresses as unity, love, power, bliss, all possibility
                        and all knowledge. In that state of consciousness, our
                        life is organised around our divine center or the
                        psychic being.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yoga also seeks to answer the questions such as why we
                        are born, who we are we, what this world is, why this
                        world was created, who created the world, and where we
                        are headed.
                        Yoga also has tools such as asanas, pranayama, meditation,
                        chanting, prayer, constant remembrance and offering, and
                        dispassionate work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yoga eventually refers to a goal. The goal is the union
                        of the individual soul with the divine. In order to effect
                        this union, one part of the being like our mind, body, or
                        emotions can be taken as the starting point to connect our
                        individual self to the divine, or our entire being can be
                        used to effect this link.
                        If our individual personality is driven by knowledge and
                        learning, then we can start with seeking answers to the
                        eternal questions through reading, inquiry and deliberation.
                        These eternal questions have been asked since millennia,
                        more intensely in India than elsewhere, and there are
                        numerous texts such as the Vedas and the Upanishads
                        that answer these questions. Some exceptional beings who

                        realised these truths, noted down their experiences in
                        words for all of humanity to benefit from them. However,
                        even though this knowledge has been available to us since
                        millennia, humanity as a whole has not evolved or gone
                        through a transformation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This tell us that for realizing the higher realities, mental
                        knowledge can be only a starting point. It can be the
                        magnet that pulls us to the object of our knowledge. But
                        if we stay content with just the mental knowledge, nothing
                        real is attained by us and our nature continues to be what
                        we were before getting the new knowledge. For example,
                        we can understand and learn the concept of One in all,
                        that the Divine is one and from Himself He created many.
                        Therefore, we are all one. But till we get a true experience
                        of unity with everything and everyone, we can only operate
                        from a limited place within us, our Mind. We continue to
                        feel isolated from others, we continue to divide people into
                        categories such as friends, family, enemy, self and nonself. We continue to work primarily with the intention of
                        self-gain. The knowledge of our oneness does lend to us a
                        compassionate leaning and an empathetic approach to our
                        relations, but it is not complete and hence marred with
                        imperfections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mentally, most people know that we are not the body or
                        the mind, but the Soul. But how many truly live their life
                        making this the central feature? Almost all of us organise
                        our life around the ego, and the world is a reflection of
                        this today. This means that until we get a real experience
                        of ourselves as the Soul, we are not able to translate the
                        mental knowledge into our everyday life.
                        Does this mean we should not seek or try to learn anything
                        mentally?

                    <h6>The Call Beyond | 15 July 2021 </h6>
                    <p>
                        ‘Yoga and Meditation’ is an expression used so commonly
                        that nobody feels even the need to pause and think what it
                        means. It is taken to be beyond any doubt or question that
                        the expression refers to a combination of physical practices
                        (asanas and pranayamas), which is yoga; and a technique by
                        which the mind can be free of stress, which is meditation.
                        Both types of techniques, asanas and pranayamas, as well
                        as meditation, are quite fashionable today. Within these
                        techniques also, people try to minimize effort. They start
                        looking for specific asanas, which would help them ‘cure’
                        a specific disease like diabetes or hypothyroidism. In short,
                        ‘Yoga and Meditation’ is seen as a set of techniques which
                        are an easy way to good health. I don’t agree with this very
                        dwarfed view of the grand discipline that yoga really is.
                        To justify myself, let me begin by writing about yoga.
                        According to Sri Aurobindo, yoga is a methodised effect
                        towards self-perfection. Its ultimate aim is achieving union
                        with the Divine. We human beings are imperfect beings;
                        the perfect being is the Divine. So, yoga means a systematic
                        way of moving towards the Divine. The movement towards
                        the divine is long and difficult. So, a systematic method is
                        necessary. This systematic route is the use of yogic techniques,
                        which include not only asanas and pranayamas but also
                        meditation. Thus, the first error in the expression ‘Yoga and
                        Meditation’ is that yoga includes meditation. Therefore, in the
                        expression ‘Yoga and Meditation’, ‘Meditation’ is redundant.
                        Meditation is a part of yoga. The second error is that doing
                        these techniques does not by itself constitute yoga. These
                        techniques have to be done with the yogic attitude which will lead to the movement towards the perfect being. The third
                        error is that the yogic attitude is not restricted to the time
                        when one is doing these techniques. The yogic attitude is
                        required throughout the day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is the attitude with which the yogic techniques should
                        be done? The attitude is that although we do them to make
                        the body and the mind fit, we want the body and the mind
                        to be fit so that they can be suitable and durable instruments
                        for doing what the Divine expects of us. It is only with
                        this attitude that the asanas become yogasanas. Without this
                        attitude, they are just asanas (postures), not yogasanas. On
                        the other hand, with the yogic attitude, even other exercises
                        such as walking, jogging, cycling or swimming become a
                        part of yoga.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is the attitude that a practitioner of yoga should have
                        when not doing the techniques? The yogic attitude involves
                        three parts. First, without any ego, everything that one does
                        should be done as an instrument of the Divine. Yogasanas
                        and meditation sharpen the instrument so that it can serve
                        the Divine better. Secondly, all work is done as an offering
                        to the Divine, with no desire for reward. This brings great
                        mental peace. Finally, since all work is offered to the Divine,
                        it is done with love, and to the best of one’s ability, so that it
                        is fit as an offering to the Divine. By living with such attitude,
                        yoga becomes a journey to reach the Divine. Since the attitude
                        is required all twenty-four hours, all life becomes yoga. That
                        is why, Sri Aurobindo said, “All life is yoga.”
