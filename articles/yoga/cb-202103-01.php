                        Yoga refers to the movement of the individual from an
                        ordinary state of consciousness driven by personal desires
                        and impulses towards a state of higher consciousness,
                        which expresses as unity, love, power, bliss, all possibility
                        and all knowledge. In that state of consciousness, our
                        life is organised around our divine center or the
                        psychic being.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yoga also seeks to answer the questions such as why we
                        are born, who we are we, what this world is, why this
                        world was created, who created the world, and where we
                        are headed.
                        Yoga also has tools such as asanas, pranayama, meditation,
                        chanting, prayer, constant remembrance and offering, and
                        dispassionate work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yoga eventually refers to a goal. The goal is the union
                        of the individual soul with the divine. In order to effect
                        this union, one part of the being like our mind, body, or
                        emotions can be taken as the starting point to connect our
                        individual self to the divine, or our entire being can be
                        used to effect this link.
                        If our individual personality is driven by knowledge and
                        learning, then we can start with seeking answers to the
                        eternal questions through reading, inquiry and deliberation.
                        These eternal questions have been asked since millennia,
                        more intensely in India than elsewhere, and there are
                        numerous texts such as the Vedas and the Upanishads
                        that answer these questions. Some exceptional beings who

                        realised these truths, noted down their experiences in
                        words for all of humanity to benefit from them. However,
                        even though this knowledge has been available to us since
                        millennia, humanity as a whole has not evolved or gone
                        through a transformation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This tell us that for realizing the higher realities, mental
                        knowledge can be only a starting point. It can be the
                        magnet that pulls us to the object of our knowledge. But
                        if we stay content with just the mental knowledge, nothing
                        real is attained by us and our nature continues to be what
                        we were before getting the new knowledge. For example,
                        we can understand and learn the concept of One in all,
                        that the Divine is one and from Himself He created many.
                        Therefore, we are all one. But till we get a true experience
                        of unity with everything and everyone, we can only operate
                        from a limited place within us, our Mind. We continue to
                        feel isolated from others, we continue to divide people into
                        categories such as friends, family, enemy, self and nonself. We continue to work primarily with the intention of
                        self-gain. The knowledge of our oneness does lend to us a
                        compassionate leaning and an empathetic approach to our
                        relations, but it is not complete and hence marred with
                        imperfections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mentally, most people know that we are not the body or
                        the mind, but the Soul. But how many truly live their life
                        making this the central feature? Almost all of us organise
                        our life around the ego, and the world is a reflection of
                        this today. This means that until we get a real experience
                        of ourselves as the Soul, we are not able to translate the
                        mental knowledge into our everyday life.
                        Does this mean we should not seek or try to learn anything
                        mentally?
                    </p>
<p>                    Here we might need to look at the individual nature of a  person. Some people must know and understand something clearly.  Some  people  have  faith  and  devotion,  and  don’t care for mental knowledge. Yet  others  believe  in  working,  and through  work,  finding  answers.  Hence  it  is  not  wrong to try to learn yoga, to seek to know what is implies, its methods,  its  various  turns,  paths,  its  powers,   the   peace and joy it can bring. But until we translate what we know mentally into action  and  everyday  living,  it  stays  at  the level of  the  mind  and  doesn’t  take  us  closer  to  the  object of  our  learning  –   the  Divine.  Unless  we   make  the  voice   of  the  psychic  the  central  unifying  principle  of   our   life and follow its dictates,  we  are  still  not  practicing  yoga.  When the knowledge we gain mentally  is  also  put  into practice by  making  the  right  choices  every  minute  of  our life and following that choice, then we can say that we are practicing yoga.  Hence,  to  progress  on  the  spiritual  path, we must make yoga not just a mental seeking but the most important pursuit in our life where every thought, every  feeling,  every  action  must   be   offered  to   the   divine.  That is why, yoga is not simply something to be learnt, it is something to be lived.
