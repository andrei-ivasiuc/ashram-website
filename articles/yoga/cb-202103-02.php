‘Yoga and Meditation’ is an expression  used  so  commonly  that nobody feels even the need to pause and think what it means. It is taken to be  beyond  any  doubt  or  question  that the expression refers to a combination of physical practices (asanas and pranayamas), which is yoga; and a technique by which the mind can be free of stress,  which  is  meditation. Both  types  of  techniques,  asanas  and  pranayamas,  as  well  as meditation, are quite fashionable today. Within these techniques also, people try to minimize effort. They start looking  for  specific  asanas,  which  would  help  them  ‘cure’   a specific disease like diabetes or hypothyroidism. In short, ‘Yoga and Meditation’ is seen as  a  set  of  techniques  which  are an easy way to good health. I don’t agree with this very dwarfed view of the grand discipline that yoga really is.
</p>
<p>
To justify myself, let me begin by writing about yoga.  According to Sri Aurobindo, yoga is a methodised effect towards self-perfection. Its ultimate aim is achieving  union  with  the  Divine.  We  human  beings  are   imperfect  beings; the perfect being is the Divine. So, yoga means  a  systematic way of moving towards the Divine.  The  movement  towards the divine is long and difficult. So, a systematic method is necessary. This systematic route is the use of yogic techniques, which include not only asanas and pranayamas but also meditation. Thus, the first error in the expression ‘Yoga and Meditation’ is that yoga includes meditation. Therefore, in the expression ‘Yoga and Meditation’, ‘Meditation’ is redundant. Meditation is a part of yoga. The second error  is  that  doing these techniques does not by itself constitute yoga. These techniques have to be done with the yogic attitude which will lead to the movement towards the perfect being.  The  third  error is that the yogic attitude is not restricted to  the  time  when one is doing these techniques. The yogic attitude is required throughout the day.
</p>
<p>

What is  the attitude with which the yogic techniques should  be done? The attitude is that although we  do them to make   the body and the mind fit, we  want  the body and the mind    to be fit so that they can be suitable and durable instruments for doing what  the  Divine  expects  of  us.  It  is  only  with this attitude that the asanas become yogasanas. Without this attitude, they are just asanas (postures),  not  yogasanas.  On the other hand, with the yogic attitude, even other exercises such as walking, jogging, cycling  or  swimming  become  a  part of yoga.
</p>
<p>

What is the attitude that a practitioner of yoga should have when not doing the techniques? The yogic attitude involves three parts. First, without any ego, everything that one does should be done as an instrument  of  the  Divine.  Yogasanas  and meditation sharpen the instrument  so  that  it  can  serve the Divine better. Secondly,  all  work  is  done  as  an  offering  to the Divine, with no desire for reward. This brings great mental peace. Finally, since all work is offered to the Divine,      it is done with love, and to the best of one’s ability, so that it      is fit as an offering to the Divine. By living with such attitude, yoga becomes a journey to reach the Divine. Since the attitude is required all twenty-four hours, all life becomes yoga. That    is why, Sri Aurobindo said, “All life is yoga.”
