                        Yoga refers to the movement of the individual from an
                        "ordinary state of consciousness driven by personal desires and impulses towards a state of
                        higher consciousness, which expresses as unity, love, power, bliss, all possibility and all knowledge.
                        In that state of consciousness," our life is organised around our
                        divine center or the psychic being.
                        Yoga also seeks to answer the questions such as why
                        "we are born, who we are we, what this world is, why this world was created, who created the
                        world, and
                        where we are headed."
                        "Yoga also has tools such as asanas, pranayama, meditation, chanting, prayer, constant
                        remembrance and
                        offering, and dispassionate work."
                        "Yoga eventually refers to a goal. The goal is the union of the individual soul with the divine.
                        In order to
                        effect this union, one part of the being like our mind, body, or emotions can be taken as the
                        starting point
                        to connect our individual self to the divine, or our entire being can be used to effect this
                        link."
                        "If our individual personality is driven by knowledge and learning, then we can start with
                        seeking answers
                        to the eternal questions through reading, inquiry and deliberation. These eternal questions have
                        been asked
                        since millennia, more intensely in India than elsewhere, and there are numerous texts such as
                        the Vedas and
                        the Upanishads that answer these questions. Some exceptional beings who realised these truths,
                        noted down
                        their experiences in words for all of humanity to"
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        "benefit from them. However, even though this knowledge has been available to us since
                        millennia, humanity
                        as a whole has not evolved or gone through a transformation."
                        "This tell us that for realizing the higher realities, mental knowledge can be only a starting
                        point. It can
                        be the magnet that pulls us to the object of our knowledge. But if we stay content with just the
                        mental
                        knowledge, nothing real is attained by us and our nature continues to be what we were before
                        getting the new
                        knowledge. For example, we can understand and learn the concept of One in all, that the Divine
                        is one and
                        from Himself He created many. Therefore, we are all one. But till we get a true experience of
                        unity with
                        everything and everyone, we can only operate from a limited place within us, our Mind. We
                        continue to feel
                        isolated from others, we continue to divide people into categories such as friends, family,
                        enemy, self and
                        non- self. We continue to work primarily with the intention of self-gain. The knowledge of our
                        oneness does
                        lend to us a compassionate leaning and an empathetic approach to our relations, but it is not
                        complete and
                        hence marred with imperfections."
                        "Mentally, most people know that we are not the body or the mind, but the Soul. But how many
                        truly live
                        their life making this the central feature? Almost all of us organise our life around the ego,
                        and the world
                        is a reflection of this today. This means that until we get a real experience of ourselves as
                        the Soul, we
                        are not able to translate the mental knowledge into our everyday life."
                        Does this mean we should not seek or try to learn anything mentally?
                        Here we might need to look at the individual nature of a
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "person. Some people must know and understand something clearly. Some people have faith and
                        devotion, and
                        don’t care for mental knowledge. Yet others believe in working, and through work, finding
                        answers. Hence it
                        is not wrong to try to learn yoga, to seek to know what is implies, its methods, its various
                        turns, paths,
                        its powers, the peace and joy it can bring. But until we translate what we know mentally into
                        action and
                        everyday living, it stays at the level of the mind and doesn’t take us closer to the object of
                        our learning
                        – the Divine. Unless we make the voice of the psychic the central unifying principle of our life
                        and follow
                        its dictates, we are still not practicing yoga. When the knowledge we gain mentally is also put
                        into
                        practice by making the right choices every minute of our life and following that choice, then we
                        can say
                        that we are practicing yoga. Hence, to progress on the spiritual path, we must make yoga not
                        just a mental
                        seeking but the most important pursuit in our life where every thought, every feeling, every
                        action must be
                        offered to the divine. That is why, yoga is not simply something to be learnt, it is something
                        to be lived."

                        ‘Yoga and Meditation’ is an expression used so commonly
                        "that nobody feels even the need to pause and think what it means. It is taken to be beyond any
                        doubt or
                        question that the expression refers to a combination of physical practices (asanas and
                        pranayamas), which is
                        yoga; and a technique by which the mind can be free of stress, which is meditation. Both types
                        of
                        techniques, asanas and pranayamas, as well as meditation, are quite fashionable today. Within
                        these
                        techniques also, people try to minimize effort. They start looking for specific asanas, which
                        would help
                        them ‘cure’ a specific disease like diabetes or hypothyroidism. In short, ‘Yoga and Meditation’
                        is seen as a
                        set of techniques which are an easy way to good health. I don’t agree with this very dwarfed
                        view of the
                        grand discipline that yoga really is."
                        "To justify myself, let me begin by writing about yoga. According to Sri Aurobindo, yoga is a
                        methodised
                        effect towards self-perfection. Its ultimate aim is achieving union with the Divine. We human
                        beings are
                        imperfect beings; the perfect being is the Divine. So, yoga means a systematic way of moving
                        towards the
                        Divine. The movement towards the divine is long and difficult. So, a systematic method is
                        necessary. This
                        systematic route is the use of yogic techniques, which include not only asanas and pranayamas
                        but also
                        meditation. Thus, the first error in the expression ‘Yoga and Meditation’ is that yoga includes
                        meditation.
                        Therefore, in the expression ‘Yoga and Meditation’, ‘Meditation’ is redundant. Meditation is a
                        part of yoga.
                        The second error is that doing these techniques does not by itself constitute yoga. These
                        techniques have to
                        be done with the yogic attitude which will lead to the"
