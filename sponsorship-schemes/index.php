                        What we are attempting here is to prove to the world, through a concrete example,
                        that by some inner psychological realisation and some outer organisation a world
                        can be created where most of the causes of human misery will cease to exist.

                        We, at Sri Aurobindo Ashram - Delhi branch, are essentially focused on supporting
                        education as we strongly believe that giving integral education to a child is our greatest
                        achievement. It is our mission to touch as many lives as possible. To garner support for this
                        cause we have initiated various sponsorship schemes from individuals and the corporate
                        sector, which have gained momentum in the past years.
                        This year the pandemic has created unprecedented situation for the students as well
                        as the teachers. The past few months have been difficult for everyone and specially for
                        students. We have witnessed that students across all schools are demonstrating incredible
                        energy, commitment and flexibility as they continue to respond to the mass disruption
                        caused by the pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our schools have adapted to new teaching techniques with virtual lessons. The disruption
                        caused by the pandemic has created a need for teachers to be more creative than usual,
                        employing new measures and in some cases developing completely new skills sets to
                        ensure the successful continuation of the teaching-learning process.
                        Many corporate and individual sponsors have appreciated our work and extended
                        financial support to us to enable us to overcome this crisis. The children of our schools
                        in rural India benefited and their numbers continue to grow. The children in remote areas,
                        tribal population and villages in the hilly areas are being educated under these schemes.
                        The sponsored children are selected from low income groups and educated in good village
                        boarding schools in their own state to avoid language problems. The entire expense of their
                        tuition, boarding, lodging, training, books, clothes, travel and medical expenses is borne
                        by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram - Delhi Branch. Additionally, a few students in The Motherâ€™s
                        International School, from the economically weaker section are also provided scholarships
                        under the sponsorship programme.

                        The Auro Mira Vidya Mandir, a free primary school for over 165 tribal children in
                        Kechla, Odisha is also mainly supported by Sri Aurobindo Ashram-Delhi branch as part of
                        sponsorship programmes. The children preferred to stay in the school hostel during these
                        tough times and were kept in very safe and healthy surroundings. All safety precautions to
                        protect against Covid 19 were followed.

                        The sponsorship schemes have been largely used to support children and youth mainly
                        under the following four main categories:

                    <p>
                        There are more than 500 Sri Aurobindo Schools all over the country which are run by
                        devotees independently. A number of children in these schools are sponsored by the Sri
                        Aurobindo Ashram - Delhi branch. These children are provided with books, clothing, games
                        and sports equipment among other essential items from time to time.
                        At the end of the academic year, the sponsors are provided with the progress report of
                        each child supported by them.

                        Many of our Ashram Youth after finishing class XII are pursuing their online graduation in
                        different streams. We sponsor their undergraduate studies and thereafter career-oriented
                        courses.

                    <p>
                        Sri Aurobindo Ashram-Delhi branch also has a vocational training programme for the
                        youth of weaker strata of the society to upgrade their skills and knowledge. As part of this
                        programme, the youth undergo structured training of six months in the areas of cooking,
                        carpentry, photo-framing and lamination, hand-made paper making, tailoring and weaving
                        (for girls), civil and electrical maintenance, library science, computer and typing, and paramedical training.
                        After the successful completion of the course, most trainees could be successfully placed
                        in jobs. A few trainees, however, continue to work in the Ashram in various departments.
                        The Ashram extends financial support to them and they are encouraged to take up courses
                        of their choice. During 2020-21 there were on an average 28 vocational trainees in the
                        Ashram.
