                        <p>Shri Surendra Nath Jauhar had procured a vast expanse of waste land, which lay fallow for many years. The barrenness of the land stretched long between the vision and its translation into action. Daylight was caught and lost between the brambles and thorny bushes covering it.</p>

                        <p>The Divine process unfurled itself in its full glory with the arrival of Sri Aurobindo’s relics on 4 December 1957. The relics stood serene and majestic on the altar. The delicate fragrance of flowers and incense gave the place an ethereal touch and hundreds of devotees sat in silent prayer, their eyes ablaze with an ardent aspiration. The relics were enshrined at the base of the marble cube in a sombre and dignified ceremony on the pious morning of 5 December 1957.</p>

                        <p>Chachaji paints a mesmerizing picture of the heavens offering their oblations… "Clouds and the sun competed with each other to offer their 'Shradhanjali', thus investing the atmosphere with enchanting and dramatic colour and beauty. Gods also did not lag behind and they sent the rainbow as their colourful offering."</p>
