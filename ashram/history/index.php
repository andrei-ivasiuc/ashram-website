                        <p>Shri Surendra Nath Jauhar had procured a vast expanse of waste land, which lay fallow for many years. The barrenness of the land stretched long between the vision and its translation into action. Daylight was caught and lost between the brambles and thorny bushes covering it.</p>

                        <p>Things now began moving. Chachaji made elaborate plans for the development of the land and met The Mother for guidance. The Divine plan was set and the auspicious moment for its enaction had finally arrived. The Mother said, "This place will house the Sri Aurobindo Ashram — Delhi Branch, and there certainly will be a Shrine for which I have been keeping Sri Aurobindo’s precious relics." The Mother fixed the date 12 February 1956 for the inauguration of Sri Aurobindo Ashram — Delhi Branch.</p>

                        <p>On the opening day, The Mother's message was: "Let this place be worthy of its name and manifest the true spirit of Sri Aurobindo’s teaching and message to the world. With my blessings." - The Mother She said, "Twelve persons can sit in meditation on that day. It is an old belief that if twelve persons join in solemn prayer—the prayer is granted." Thus was laid the cornerstone of an edifice which would enshrine the Divine essence.</p>

                        <p>The Divine process unfurled itself in its full glory with the arrival of Sri Aurobindo’s relics on 4 December 1957. The relics stood serene and majestic on the altar. The delicate fragrance of flowers and incense gave the place an ethereal touch and hundreds of devotees sat in silent prayer, their eyes ablaze with an ardent aspiration. The relics were enshrined at the base of the marble cube in a sombre and dignified ceremony on the pious morning of 5 December 1957.</p>

                        <p>Chachaji paints a mesmerizing picture of the heavens offering their oblations… "Clouds and the sun competed with each other to offer their 'Shradhanjali', thus investing the atmosphere with enchanting and dramatic colour and beauty. Gods also did not lag behind and they sent the rainbow as their colourful offering."</p>
