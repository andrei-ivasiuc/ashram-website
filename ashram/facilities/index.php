                        <p class="fs-5">The Centre of&nbsp;Photography was inaugurated on&nbsp;24&nbsp;April 1979 by&nbsp;Sri Surendra Nath Jauhar, Chairman, Delhi Branch with the following message:</p>
                        <p> &laquo;Let this Centre of&nbsp;Photography inaugurated today in&nbsp;Sri Aurobindo Ashram&nbsp;&mdash; Delhi Branch, revolutionize the spirit of&nbsp;photography, that the expressions caught, processed and developed bring out and reveal the Divine Spirit.&raquo;</p>
                        <p>The Centre provides photographs of&nbsp;Ashram functions, outings and excursions, exhibitions, publications etc. Photographs of&nbsp;Sri Aurobindo and The Mother are also available.</p>

                        <p>The first studio started as&nbsp;a&nbsp;dark room to&nbsp;develop the negatives of&nbsp;photographs taken by&nbsp;Tara di. With the advent of&nbsp;digital photography, the dark room was converted into a&nbsp;recording studio in&nbsp;which currently in-house meditation music, talks and reading sessions are recorded to&nbsp;be&nbsp;distributed and archived, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;recordings for both the schools, The Mother&raquo;s International School and mirambika in&nbsp;support of&nbsp;school programmes. </p>
                        <p>Tapan&nbsp;da, who joined the Ashram in&nbsp;1980, learnt photography techniques from Tara di&nbsp;and took charge of&nbsp;the studio and, to&nbsp;this day, remains with the studio, overseeing its functions.</p>
