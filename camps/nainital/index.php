                        <p>The lofty peaks of the Himalayas have had an irresistible attraction for the people of India from the dawn of civilization and probably earlier as well. Renowned as the abode of Shiva, the hoary shrines on the peaks of this highest mountain range on earth attract devout pilgrims from all corners of India. These mountains figure in history and legand as abode of sages and philosophers. From these sacred peaks, again, flow Sindhu and Ganga, on the banks of which was nursed the Indian civilization, through the ups and downs of history.</p>
                        <p>Van Niwas, Nainital, is an Ashram retreat in the Himalayas, picturesquely situated at a height of about 8000 feet (2200 meters). The very surroundings induce calms and peace and it is an ideal place for silent contemplation.</p>
