                <h3>Sri Aurobindo Ashram â€” Delhi Branch</h3>
                <p>
                    This Ashram has been created with another object than that ordinarily common to such institutions, not for the renunciation of the world but as a centre and field of practice for the evolution of another kind and form of life which would in the final end be moved by a higher spiritual consciousness and embody a greater life of the spirit.
                </p>
